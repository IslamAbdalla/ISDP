# ISDP
This is an on-going version of my ISDP code. It is not finished yet, there ARE bugs that are not fixed yet, and the code depends on the circuit, of course.

However, you are free to take a look at it, get ideas, and contribute back. If you want to contribute, you can either talk to me directly or send me a PM here or on facebook.
